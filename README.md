### I wonder if people in **The Matrix** actually coded before...

This picture is ~~not~~ from **The Matrix**.

In the words of *Morpheus*:

I feel like *Morpheus* would be the type to type the command `del -f System32` so he could ***break*** the simulation.

DON'T TYPE THAT IN THAT WOULD BE BAD!

Something you could type in is:
```
mkdir HappyPlace
cd HappyPlace
```

You'd then be in a folder called HappyPlace...
and hopefully you'd be happy...
because it's your HappyPlace.

[This](HappyPlace.md) is my HappyPlace.
